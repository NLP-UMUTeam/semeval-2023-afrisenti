# Abstract
These working notes summarize the participation of the UMUTeam in the SemEval 2023 shared task: AfriSent, focused on three-level Sentiment Analysis task in several African languages. Two sub-tasks are proposed, one in which each language is considered separately and another one in which all languages are merged. Our proposal to solve both sub-tasks is grounded on the combination of features extracted from several multilingual Large Language Models and a subset of language-independent linguistic features. Our best results are achieved with the African languages less represented in the training set: Xitsonga, a Mozambique Dialect, with a weighted f1-score of 54.89%; Algerian Arabic, with a weighted f1-score of 68.52%; Swahili, with a weighted f1-score of 60.52%; and Twi, with a weighted f1-score of 71.14%.
